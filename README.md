# grocery-app


While learning how to program, I created this app to solve my own problems. The Grocery App is designed to fix the real life problem of always forgetting what groceries you need, or struggling to find a store you’ve registered with. The app helps me organise shopping lists and track what’s needed in-store. It also helps you check off items from your grocery list as you buy them. Get Grocery App today and never worry about forgetting that one item again. I know what you’re thinking, then who am I? I’m Maja and I have a Grocery App.


Why only one commit?

Because its’s just a final state of the commits I did privately during learning and now I am cleaning up this code and applying my latest knowledge so you can see the final version of the project soon :)
